# Zen Garden

MERN starter (Vite + Tailwind client, Express + Mongoose server).

Quick setup (run these from the project root):

```bash
# create folders (already created by files in this repo)
cd /workspace/zen-garden

# Server
cd server
npm install
# then start in dev mode
npm run dev

# Client
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Add your MongoDB URI to `server/.env` (use `server/.env.example` as reference).
- `client` is a Vite app with Tailwind configured.
